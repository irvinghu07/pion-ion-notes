## Real-time communication for the web

> With WebRTC, you can add **real-time communication** capabilities to your application that works on top of an open standard. It supports **video, voice, and generic data** to be sent between peers, allowing developers to build powerful **voice- and video-communication solutions**. The technology is available on all modern **browsers** as well as on native clients for all major platforms. The technologies behind WebRTC are implemented as an open web standard and available as **regular JavaScript APIs in all major browsers**. For native clients, like Android and iOS applications, **a library is available that provides the same functionality.** The WebRTC project is [open-source](https://webrtc.googlesource.com/src/) and supported by Apple, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla, amongst others. This page is maintained by the Google WebRTC team.
