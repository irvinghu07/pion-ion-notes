**What is etcd?**

**etcd** is a strongly consistent, distributed **key-value store** that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to **be accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines**. It gracefully handles leader elections during **network partitions** and can **tolerate machine failure**, even in the leader node.

Applications of any complexity, from a simple web app to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), can read data from and write data into etcd.

Your applications can read from and write data into etcd. A simple use case is storing database connection details or feature flags in etcd as key-value pairs. These values can be watched, allowing your app to reconfigure itself when they change. Advanced uses take advantage of etcdâ€™s consistency guarantees to implement database leader elections or perform distributed locking across a cluster of workers.

etcd is open source, available [on GitHub](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd), and backed by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/).
